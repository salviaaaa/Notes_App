## Project Structure üìÅ

The project utilizes React components and state management to handle note operations efficiently. It implements controlled components for form inputs and uses array mapping to display the notes list.

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your computer
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Git
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Installation

To install and run the Personal Notes App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/salviaaaa/Notes_App.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Notes_App
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

### Using Vite.js with React

Vite is a modern build tool that provides a fast development environment for web applications. When you run the development server, Vite serves your application at `http://localhost:5173/`. This allows for hot module replacement (HMR), meaning that any changes you make to your code will be reflected in the browser without needing a full page reload. This significantly speeds up the development process and improves the developer experience.

#### Steps to Set Up Vite.js with React

**Step 1 - Install Node.js**

Before we proceed, you need to install Node.js on your computer. If you haven't installed it yet, you can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en/). 

To check if Node.js is installed successfully, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

**Step 2 - Create a React Project with Vite**

Once Node.js is installed, you can create a new React project using Vite. Navigate to the folder where you want to store your project and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm create vite@latest react-crud -- --template react
```

If the command runs successfully, it will create a new project folder named `react-crud`.

Next, navigate into the project folder:

```bash
cd react-crud
```

**Step 3 - Install Required Libraries**

Run the following command to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
npm install
```

Please wait for the installation process to complete and ensure you are connected to the internet.

**Step 4 - Run the React Project with Vite**

After the installation process is complete, run the following command to start your React project using Vite:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If successful, your project will be running at `http://localhost:5173/`. You can open this URL in your web browser to view the application.

## Usage üíª

The application provides an intuitive interface where you can:
- Create new notes using the input form
- Search for specific notes using the search bar
- Archive/unarchive notes as needed
- Delete notes you no longer need
- View remaining character count while typing note titles
